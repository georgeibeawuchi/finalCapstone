# Data Structures - Lists and Dictionaries

This project is for a cafe.

A menu of four items is entered. a dictionary called "stock", where it is the stock value of each item and another dictionary called "price" is the price of each item.

The total_stock calculates the value of the items in the menu, looping through the two dictionaries to output the final result.
