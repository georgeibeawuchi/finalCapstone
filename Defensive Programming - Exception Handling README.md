# Defensive Programming - Exception Handling

This program is a simple calculator where it asks the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, /, *). It then prints out the answer and then stores the output into a file. Exception Handling is used to prevent errors in the user's inputs and unexpected events.

The program then gives the user an option to enter two more numbers and an operation or to enter the filename to print out the equation and answer into a text file. Exception Handling is used to prevent the wrong filename being entered.
