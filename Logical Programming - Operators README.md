# Logical Programming - Operators

This project is about a user receiving awards based on their total race time. The program asks the user to enter their swimming, cycling and running time respectively, and then adds them up into a single integer/string.

It then utilises the if statement where if they produce a certain time, certain awards are outputted. If they go over a specific time, then they receive no award.
